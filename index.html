            <p>Highland cattle are one of the oldest breeds of cattle. While it technically isn't the oldest breed, the Highland cattle registry was estabilished in 1885 which makes highland cows the oldest registered breed.</p>
            <p>There is a lot of debate about the orgin of these shaggy cows. They've been grazing Scottish landscapes since the sixth century but many believe that rather than being native to Scotland they were imported from Scandanavia when the vikings invaded Great Britain.</p>
            <p>These cattle played an important role in the development of Scotland. They were used for transportation, food, textiles, and trade.</p>

            <p>Highland cows are widely known for their most distinctive feature - their shaggy wool. Their long coats make them very hardy and allows them to easily handle snowy winters. While the most well known highland cows are a reddish brown color, that isn't the only color you can find them in. Highland cattle can also be black, white, yellow, gray, silver, or brown.</p>
            <p>Both highland bulls and cows usually have long horns. They are on average around 1300 pounds and 3 and a half feet tall.</p>

            <h2>Facts about the Highland Cow</h2>
            <p>Highland cattle are a unique breed! Here are some of my favorite facts about these adorable and fluffy cows.</p>
            <ul class="factlist">
                <li>Their long wool can be cut and spun into yarn. This yarn can then be knit into clothes, hats, and tons of other useful things!</li>
                <li>Highland cow milk has a higher butterfat than most milk making them a favorite for house cows (cows kept by a single family for milk).</li>
                <li>They aren't just grazers, they are also foragers. When it snows they use their horns to dig and find plants. Highland cows will also eat a lot of plants other cows won't.</li>
                <li>When a highland cow is "silver" that means it has a white body and a black nose. It's a very common coloring for highland cattle!</li>
            </ul>
